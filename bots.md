# Misc
Some other projects that were fun to think about and make:

### GPT-2 Mafia Flavour Generator
In the game Mafia (aka Werewolf), the Mafia players choose someone to kill during the night. This bot gives some flavour text.

### Paraparrot
Honestly it's just a plainly annoying bot. It detects when someone says a sentence with particular structure, and mimics it but insultingly. It was fun to play with natural language toolkit in Python at least.

### Discord Blackjack
Multiplayer blackjack in Discord chat, using reactions to interact. Primarily just testing out using reactions with the Discord API.
