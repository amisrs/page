Hi, I'm a software developer.  

I'm currently a backend developer working with C# APIs, and also managing cloud deployments into Kubernetes.

In the past, I developed web apps with Python and Javascript, and I have also lectured a course on Android app development at UNSW.

Now I would like to show you some projects that I have had fun with.
